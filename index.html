                Welcome to the launch of the Irish Odyssey website. As many
                people from around the world, I found myself with a job in
                Ireland for three years and this was my first time living in
                Ireland. As a newcomer, the first year I was still learning how
                to live more like a resident and less like a tourist. There were
                a lot of lessons learned experiences. I often bumped into
                tourists from America and observed how they were like a "fish
                out of water" and were not getting the most out of their time.
                One couple had just retired and they planned an week long
                vacation in Ireland that they had talked about for many years.
                We talked and it seems they were more stressed with all the tour
                schedules than enjoying themselves and also wasting money on
                such things like overusing taxis, using hotels instead of B&B's
                which for them would have been a better option. Being in Dublin,
                I showed them where to buy all-day public transport passes and
                how to use the Dart light-rail and Dublin Bus schedule App, and
                good value pubs and restaurants that I discovered through local
                word of mouth. The purpose of this website is to collect tips
                and advice from people that have spent some time in Ireland for
                whatever reason or have been frequent visitors and would like to
                share their magic formula for a good experience with tips,
                lessons learned, hidden gems off the beaten path, and any other
                hacks. This is aimed at people finding themselves planning a
                7-10 day mini-vacation to save them from many hours of online
                searching for hotels, restaurants, activities, pubs and sites to
                visit among other things. My experience has been, my plans
                almost never lived up to my expectations and lost valuable time
                and wasted money that I didn't need I could have avoided. For a
                first-timer, Ireland can be overwhelming so I would like to help
                these visitors get the most out of their short stay with other
                peoples experiences and their tips and do's & dont's. <br>I am
                putting my own short-vacation idea based on my three years there
                figuring these things out as an example. If you would like to
                contribute with your own great short-vaction ideas in Ireland,
                submit your photos, comments, etc. and get it added to the
                website. Years after I left, I came back several times on my own
                short vacations and alway felt like I had never left and best of
                all, not making tourist mistakes.
