                Welcome to the launch of the Irish Odyssey website. As many
                people from around the world, I found myself with a job in
                Ireland for three years and this was my first time living in
                Ireland. As a newcomer, the first year I was still learning how
                to live more like a resident and less like a tourist. There were
                a lot of lessons learned experiences. <br /><br />
                I often bumped into tourists from America and observed how they
                were like a "fish out of water" and were not getting the most
                out of their time. One couple had just retired and they planned
                an week long vacation in Ireland that they had talked about for
                many years. We talked and it seems they were more stressed with
                all the tour schedules than enjoying themselves and also wasting
                money on such things like overusing taxis, using hotels instead
                of B&B's which for them would have been a better option. Being
                in Dublin, I showed them where to buy all-day public transport
                passes and how to use the Dart light-rail and Dublin Bus
                schedule App, and good value pubs and restaurants and other
                helpful tips that I discovered through local word of mouth and
                my Irish roomates and co-workers.

              <p class="intro-text">
                The purpose of this website is to collect tips and advice from
                people that have spent some time in Ireland for whatever reason
                or have been frequent visitors and would like to share their
                magic formula for a good experience with tips, lessons learned,
                hidden gems off the beaten path, and any other hacks. This is
                aimed at people finding themselves planning a 7-10 day
                mini-vacation to save them from many hours of online searching
                for hotels, restaurants, activities, pubs and sites to visit
                among other things. My experience has been, my plans almost
                never lived up to my expectations and lost valuable time and
                wasted money that I didn't need I could have avoided. For a
                first-timer, Ireland can be overwhelming so I would like to help
                these visitors get the most out of their short stay with other
                peoples experiences and their tips and do's & dont's. <br />
                <br />
                I am putting my own short-vacation idea based on my three years
                there figuring these things out as an example. If you would like
                to contribute with your own great short-vaction ideas in
                Ireland, submit your photos, comments, etc. and get it added to
                the website. Years after I left, I came back several times on my
                own short vacations and alway felt like I had never left and
                best of all, not making tourist mistakes.
