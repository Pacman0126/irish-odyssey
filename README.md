# irish-odyssey
portfolio-1 project

## Description
The Irish Odyssey is a new launch website. It is intended to help first time visitors who have a 7-10 day short vacation to get the most out of their trip. It is to collect the personal experiences of local Irish residents and frequent visitors who have positive personal experiences at hotels/B&B's etc., and sightseeing ideas. Users can upload their images, comments, tips, lessons learned and other helpful info. This is to help prospective visitors save hours and hours of online surfing in planning and booking only to have buyer's remorse. The goal is to reduce first time visitor travel stress and give them a solid footing and room to explore other things to do at their liesure.
